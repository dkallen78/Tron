# Tron
Website I'm building for Tron Insecticida

### Update

The website for desktop is where I want it, mostly. The website for mobile is shit and I can't figure out why it behaves the way it does. 

I've got the Tron page on my Pi server and it works great on Chrome which is good because of 3/4 of all people use Chrome. On Safari it sucks bad and on my Firefox I've got something injecting styles into the page... Responsive design is a pain.
