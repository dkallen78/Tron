### Update 23:02 (Mexico)

I think I have everything working how I want it to. I had to play rough w/ yahoo.com.mx mail but I have email forwarding set up from my hosting provider to my client. I have a form. I have PHP. I have JavaScript. I'm comfortable walking away from this to get back to my other projects.

### Update 22:29 (Mexico)

For some reason the boring stuff was more interesting today. I put in some regular expression form validation on the client side of my page and I'm working on putting in some tips for putting in valid data but I can't get it to display right in Chrome portrait mode. But it's late and I'm going to do it tomorrow. I'm happy with how it looks and behaves right now except for that.

### Update 22:11 (Mexico)

I don't like doing the boring stuff. I don't think anyone does. But today I wrote a PHP script to forward the contents of a form to an email address and I used a bit of JavaScript to do some basic validation of it. It's not live on the main Tron site yet but I'm going to do that tomorrow after I read a bit more about form validation and experiment a bit. I'm pretty proud of myself.

### Update 21:56 (Mexico)

I'm pretty happy with how this is turning out. The site went live yesterday but there were some things I wasn't happy with. One of them was the borders, I like them when getting an idea of where an element is, but they feel very unsophisticated. I'm still having problems with mobile browsers, especially Safari. Hopefully I'll have an implementation for that in the next few days. The next big project is a contact page w/ some PHP going on in the background. My fingers are crossed that it will work.

### Update

The website for desktop is where I want it, mostly. The website for mobile is shit and I can't figure out why it behaves the way it does. 

I've got the Tron page on my Pi server and it works great on Chrome which is good because of 3/4 of all people use Chrome. On Safari it sucks bad and on my Firefox I've got something injecting styles into the page... Responsive design is a pain.
